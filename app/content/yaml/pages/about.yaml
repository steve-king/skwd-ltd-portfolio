title: 'About me'
body: 
  I'm a creative problem solver with an eye for design, and I pride myself on creating the best user experiences possible. 
  
  I'm a contractor with over 7 years of experience in the industry - mostly agency side. I'm a frontend specialist (JavaScript, SCSS, HTML) with a wide working knowledge of modern web app frameworks (React, Angular v1, Vue), and I'm always keen to learn something new.
  
  I'm also comfortable working with a PHP/MySQL, Node or Python backend. I can design a DB schema, write up a RESTful API or build a customised WordPress CMS - whatever the project requires.

  If you have some work coming up and think I've got the skills you need, I would love to hear from you. Please take a look at my CV and drop me an email.
